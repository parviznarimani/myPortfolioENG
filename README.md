complete description of my engineering journey 
My passion 💟🕊 for electronics and technology runs in my veins, as I am an engineer by heart and soul.
🟥 🟩 🟦 But my 💲☂️🅾️®️🇾 took a twist when I faced the harsh reality of losing my dreams to the ruthless market. 

The real world is not a playground for engineers, it is a battlefield for business and businessmen. And I CHOSE to rise from the ashes and reinvent myself, like a phoenix 🔥🔥 with two mighty wings 🦅, engineering, and business. 

My journey and also my profession is fueled by powerful forces,
  ✅ Product Management
  ✅ Digital Marketing especially on LinkedIn®
  ✅ Robotics and mechatronics
